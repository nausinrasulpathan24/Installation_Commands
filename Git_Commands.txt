**********Git Commands***********

➡ Creating a new Git project
➡ Connecting it to GitHub
➡ Pushing it to your repository

Command	Meaning

echo = Create README file
git init = Start Git tracking
git add	= Prepare file
git commit = Save changes
git branch -M main = Rename branch
git remote add origin =	Connect to GitHub
git push = Upload to GitHub


echo "# Jenkins-Installation-Commands" >> README.md

✅ Creates a file named README.md
✅ Adds the text # Jenkins-Installation-Commands inside it

echo → prints text

>> → adds text to a file (creates file if not exists)

So now you have a README file in your folder.



git init

✅ Initializes a Git repository in your current folder.

This creates a hidden .git folder that tracks all changes.

Now your folder is officially a Git project.



git add README.md

✅ Adds the file to the staging area.

Git works in 3 stages:

Working Directory

Staging Area

Repository (commit)

This command prepares the file for commit.



git commit -m "first commit"

✅ Saves the staged file permanently in Git history.

commit = save snapshot

-m = message

"first commit" = commit description

Now your project has its first saved version



git branch -M main

✅ Renames the current branch to main.

-M = force rename

main = branch name

By default, Git sometimes uses master.
This command ensures your branch is named main.



git remote add origin https://github.com/nausinrasulpathan24/Jenkins-Installation-Commands.git

✅ Connects your local project to your GitHub repository.

remote = external repo

origin = nickname for GitHub repo

URL = your GitHub repository link

Now Git knows where to push your code.



git push -u origin main

✅ Uploads your local code to GitHub.

push = send code to remote

origin = remote name

main = branch name

-u = sets upstream (so next time you can just use git push)

Now your project is live on GitHub 🚀
